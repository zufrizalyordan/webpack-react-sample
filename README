before opening the index.html on browser:

1. run "npm install" on terminal
2. run "webpack" on terminal

see http://webpack.github.io/ if the current machine doesn't have webpack installed

oh and you need to run the files on a web server,
if you have Apache running, you can put the files there

or you can use node http server if you have it
